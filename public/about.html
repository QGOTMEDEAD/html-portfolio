<h1>About Me or is it....</h1>
<p>MORPHEUS Unfortunately, no one can be told what the Matrix is.  You have to see it for yourself. Morpheus opens his hands.  In the right is a red pill. In the left, a blue pill. MORPHEUS This is your last chance.  After this, there is no going back.  You take the blue pill and the story ends.  You wake in your bed and you believe whatever you want to believe. The pills in his open hands are reflected in the glasses. MORPHEUS You take the red pill and you stay in Wonderland and I show you how deep the rabbit-hole goes. Neo feels the smooth skin of the capsules, the moisture growing in his palms. MORPHEUS Remember that all I am offering is the truth.  Nothing more.</p>
<p>MORPHEUS Apoc, are we on-line? APOC Almost. He and Trinity are working quickly, hardwiring a complex system of monitors, modules and drives. MORPHEUS Neo, time is always against us. Will you take a seat there? Neo sits in a chair in the center of the room and Trinity begins gently fixing white electrode disks to him.  Near the chair is an old oval dressing mirror that is cracked. He whispers to Trinity: NEO You did all this? She nods, placing a set of headphones over his ears. They are wired to an old hotel phone. MORPHEUS The pill you took is part of a trace program.  It's designed to disrupt your input/output carrier signal so we can pinpoint your location. NEO What does that mean? CYPHER It means buckle up, Dorothy, 'cause Kansas is going bye-bye.</p>
